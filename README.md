# UFOs

# Project Overview

In this project, we constructed an HTML page in order to input data from a javascript data file. From there we wanted to filter the UFO sightings based on the US location as well as the shape of the observed UFO. 

# Results

We helped our client Dana in constructing an HTML page and provided a header and a short blurb about the existence of UFOs.
