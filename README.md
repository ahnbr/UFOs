# UFOs

# Project Overview

In this project, we constructed an HTML page in order to input data from a javascript data file. From there we wanted to filter the UFO sightings based on the US location as well as the shape of the observed UFO. 

# Results

We helped our client Dana in constructing an HTML page and provided a header and a short blurb about the existence of UFOs.

On the website, you can observe the data from the original javascript data file on the right side. We added filters to sort through the data using date, city, state, country and UFO shape. You can type in your parameters into the filter and press enter at which point you will be able to see when/what city/state/country/shape/duration of the sighting and additional comments UFOs have been spotted. For example, these are all the sightings from the data set from the state of New York.
